## Controls

- `W, A, S, D, or arrow keys` to move (video chat will start if you are close to someone else)
- `E` to sit down
- `R` to use computer (for screen sharing)
- `Enter` to open chat
- `ESC` to close chat

## Prerequisites

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinshen56714/SkyOffice.git
```

This will create a folder named `SkyOffice`. You can specify a different folder name like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinshen56714/SkyOffice.git my-folder-name
```

To start a server, go into the project folder and install dependencies/run start command:

```bash
cd SkyOffice or 'my-folder-name'
yarn && yarn start
```

To start a client, go into the client folder and install dependencies/run start command:

```bash
cd SkyOffice/client or 'my-folder-name/client'
yarn && yarn dev
```

## Deployment

The stack runs as three containers and is meant to be deployed as a Portainer
stack pointed at this repository.

| Service | What it is | Default published port |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `client` | the built app, served by nginx | 8080 |
| `server` | the Colyseus game server | 2567 |
| `peerjs` | self-hosted WebRTC signalling | 9000 |

In Portainer: **Stacks → Add stack → Repository**, point it at this repo with
`docker-compose.yml` as the compose path, then fill in the environment
variables below. Locally, `cp .env.example .env && docker compose up --build`
does the same thing.

### Environment

Every URL here is what the **browser** is told to connect to, so it has to be
reachable from wherever people open the app. Container names will not work.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SERVER_URL` | `ws://` or `wss://` URL of the `server` service. Leave empty and the client looks for a server on its own hostname at port 2567. |
| `PEER_HOST` | Hostname of the `peerjs` service. Leave empty and the client falls back to the free public PeerJS broker, which puts call metadata on a third party. |
| `PEER_PORT` / `PEER_PATH` / `PEER_SECURE` | Details for the above. Set `PEER_SECURE=false` when reaching it over plain http. |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated origins allowed to reach the matchmaking API, e.g. `https://office.example.com`. Unset means any origin is accepted. |
| `COLYSEUS_MONITOR_USER` / `COLYSEUS_MONITOR_PASSWORD` | Credentials for the `/colyseus` dashboard, which reads every room's state and can disconnect clients. **It is not mounted at all unless both are set.** |
| `CLIENT_PORT` / `SERVER_PORT` / `PEER_PUBLIC_PORT` | Host ports to publish on. |

`.env.example` has worked examples for both a reverse-proxied setup and a bare
host.

### Why the client is configured at runtime

Vite inlines `VITE_*` values at build time, so a plain build would need a new
image for every deployment. The client image writes `/config.js` from its
environment when the container starts instead, which means the same image can
be pointed anywhere by changing the stack settings and restarting. Build-time
`VITE_*` values still work as a fallback, so `yarn dev` is unaffected.

### Health checks

The server exposes `GET /health`, and both images declare a `HEALTHCHECK`, so
Portainer shows container health directly.

## Server configuration

The server reads these environment variables. All are optional in development;
the first two matter for any deployment reachable from the internet.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated origins allowed to reach the matchmaking API, e.g. `https://office.example.com`. Unset means any origin is accepted. |
| `COLYSEUS_MONITOR_USER` / `COLYSEUS_MONITOR_PASSWORD` | Credentials for the `/colyseus` monitor dashboard. The monitor can read every room's state and disconnect clients, so it is only mounted when both are set. With `NODE_ENV=production` and no credentials, it is not mounted at all. |
| `PORT` | Port to listen on (default `2567`). |

The client reads these at build time:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_SERVER_URL` | URL of the Colyseus server. Required for production builds. |
| `VITE_PEER_HOST` | Host of a self-hosted [PeerServer](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server). Unset, PeerJS uses its free public broker - signalling metadata leaves your infrastructure, availability depends on a service you do not run, and peer ids share a namespace with every other app using the default. |
| `VITE_PEER_PORT` / `VITE_PEER_PATH` / `VITE_PEER_SECURE` | Optional details for the above. Default to the host's own port, `/`, and TLS on. |

## Development

```bash
yarn test           # boots a server in-process and drives it with a real client
yarn audit:check    # fails only on advisories missing from .audit-baseline.json
yarn audit:update   # re-record the baseline after upgrading or accepting one
```

CI runs a typecheck, a client build, the test suite and the audit check on every
pull request.

`.audit-baseline.json` records the advisories we already know about, so a newly
published one fails the build while the accepted backlog does not. When you fix or
accept one, run `yarn audit:update` and commit the diff.
