## Controls

- `W, A, S, D, or arrow keys` to move (video chat will start if you are close to someone else)
- `E` to sit down
- `R` to use computer (for screen sharing)
- `Enter` to open chat
- `ESC` to close chat

## Prerequisites

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinshen56714/SkyOffice.git
```

This will create a folder named `SkyOffice`. You can specify a different folder name like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinshen56714/SkyOffice.git my-folder-name
```

To start a server, go into the project folder and install dependencies/run start command:

```bash
cd SkyOffice or 'my-folder-name'
yarn && yarn start
```

To start a client, go into the client folder and install dependencies/run start command:

```bash
cd SkyOffice/client or 'my-folder-name/client'
yarn && yarn dev
```

## Deployment

The stack runs as three containers and is meant to be deployed as a Portainer
stack pointed at this repository.

| Service | What it is | Default published port |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `client` | the built app, served by nginx | 8080 |
| `server` | the Colyseus game server | 2567 |
| `peerjs` | self-hosted WebRTC signalling | 9000 |

In Portainer: **Stacks → Add stack → Repository**, point it at this repo with
`docker-compose.yml` as the compose path, then fill in the environment
variables below. Locally, `cp .env.example .env && docker compose up --build`
does the same thing.

### Environment

Every URL here is what the **browser** is told to connect to, so it has to be
reachable from wherever people open the app. Container names will not work.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SERVER_URL` | `ws://` or `wss://` URL of the `server` service. Leave empty and the client looks for a server on its own hostname at port 2567. |
| `PEER_HOST` | Hostname of the `peerjs` service - `peer.example.com`, not `https://peer.example.com`. A URL is read apart rather than rejected, and its scheme and port stand in for `PEER_SECURE` and `PEER_PORT`. Leave empty and the client falls back to the free public PeerJS broker, which puts call metadata on a third party. |
| `PEER_PORT` / `PEER_PATH` / `PEER_SECURE` | Details for the above. Set `PEER_SECURE=false` when reaching it over plain http. |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated origins allowed to reach the matchmaking API, e.g. `https://office.example.com`. Unset means any origin is accepted. |
| `COLYSEUS_MONITOR_USER` / `COLYSEUS_MONITOR_PASSWORD` | Credentials for the `/colyseus` dashboard, which reads every room's state and can disconnect clients. **It is not mounted at all unless both are set.** |
| `CLIENT_PORT` / `SERVER_PORT` / `PEER_PUBLIC_PORT` | Host ports to publish on. |
| `OFFICE_STORE_PATH` | Where offices with a lifetime are recorded, **including their chat**. Defaults to `/app/data/offices.json` in the image, backed by the `office-data` volume. Losing this file closes every office that had a lifetime and loses its conversation. |
| `BIND_ADDRESS` | Interface those ports bind to. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`, so only the host can reach them - which is what you want when a tunnel or reverse proxy on that host forwards them. Use `0.0.0.0` to expose them to your network. |

`.env.example` has worked examples for both a reverse-proxied setup and a bare
host.

### Why the client is configured at runtime

Vite inlines `VITE_*` values at build time, so a plain build would need a new
image for every deployment. The client image writes `/config.js` from its
environment when the container starts instead, which means the same image can
be pointed anywhere by changing the stack settings and restarting. Build-time
`VITE_*` values still work as a fallback, so `yarn dev` is unaffected.

### Offices that outlive the room

When creating an office you choose how long it should last. The default closes
it once everyone leaves, and its share link dies with it. Give it a lifetime and
the office gets a stable link that keeps working for that long.

The room is still disposed once empty either way - an empty office should not
cost a running process. What survives is the office *definition*, recorded in
`OFFICE_STORE_PATH`: name, description, whether it is unlisted, the password
hash, and the conversation. Reopening the link recreates the room from that
record, which is also what stops a visitor recreating a private office without
its password.

Chat lives exactly as long as the office does. The last 100 messages are kept
beside the definition and come back when the link is reopened; when the office
expires, its conversation is pruned with it. A disposable office keeps nothing -
that is the difference between the two.

Two things follow from chat being on disk. The file now holds real conversation,
so it wants the same care as anything else with people's words in it - and the
`/colyseus` dashboard, which reads full room state, can read it back. And
messages are attributed to whatever display name someone typed, which nothing
verifies; history is a convenience, not a record.

### Health checks

The server exposes `GET /health`, and both images declare a `HEALTHCHECK`, so
Portainer shows container health directly.

## Server configuration

The server reads these environment variables. All are optional in development;
the first two matter for any deployment reachable from the internet.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated origins allowed to reach the matchmaking API, e.g. `https://office.example.com`. Unset means any origin is accepted. |
| `COLYSEUS_MONITOR_USER` / `COLYSEUS_MONITOR_PASSWORD` | Credentials for the `/colyseus` monitor dashboard. The monitor can read every room's state and disconnect clients, so it is only mounted when both are set. With `NODE_ENV=production` and no credentials, it is not mounted at all. |
| `PORT` | Port to listen on (default `2567`). |

The client is normally configured at runtime by the container - see
[Deployment](#deployment). These build-time equivalents are the fallback, used
when nothing is set at runtime, which is what `yarn dev` and any hand-rolled
static build rely on:

| Variable | Runtime equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_SERVER_URL` | `SERVER_URL` |
| `VITE_PEER_HOST` | `PEER_HOST` |
| `VITE_PEER_PORT` / `VITE_PEER_PATH` / `VITE_PEER_SECURE` | `PEER_PORT` / `PEER_PATH` / `PEER_SECURE` |

Leaving `VITE_PEER_HOST` and `PEER_HOST` both unset makes PeerJS use its free
public broker: signalling metadata leaves your infrastructure, availability
depends on a service you do not run, and peer ids share a namespace with every
other app using the default. The stack runs a
[PeerServer](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server) so you do not have to.

## Development

```bash
yarn test           # boots a server in-process and drives it with a real client
yarn audit:check    # fails only on advisories missing from .audit-baseline.json
yarn audit:update   # re-record the baseline after upgrading or accepting one
```

CI runs a typecheck, a client build, the test suite and the audit check on every
pull request.

`.audit-baseline.json` records the advisories we already know about, so a newly
published one fails the build while the accepted backlog does not. When you fix or
accept one, run `yarn audit:update` and commit the diff.
